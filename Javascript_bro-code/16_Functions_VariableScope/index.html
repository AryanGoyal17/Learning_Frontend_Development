    <h1>Functions and Variable Scope in Js</h1><hr>

    <pre>
        Functions: A section of reusable code.
                   Declare code once, use it whenever you want.
                   Call the function to execute that code.

        Same as Functions in C....

        Variable Scope: Where a variable is recognized and accessible (local vs global)
        
        (a) Local scope: Variable accessible and recognizable inside curly braces portion only (usually fn, loop, if-else etc..).
        (b) Global scope: Variable accessible and recognizable throughout the program.

        Note: 1-- One fn cant read what is inside another fn..
              2-- If 2 variables with same name inside both local or global scope are used when a fn is called, then preference 
                  is given to the one in local scope(see Example in Console + index.js file)
