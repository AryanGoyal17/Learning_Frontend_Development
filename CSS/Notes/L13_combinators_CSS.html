      Combinators = explains the relationship between listed selectors

      Different types of combinators are--
      (a)  = descendant(1 space)
      (b)> = child
      (c)~ = general sibling
      (d)+ = adjacent sibling

    -->

    <!--EXPLAINING THE RELATIONSHIPS!-->


    <!-- All children are descendants but not all descendants are children
    <div id = "container">
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        </div>

    <p id = "p1"></p>  
         <p id = "p2"></p>

    In the code above all three p inside container div are descendants of container but only first 2 p are child.. not the 3rd one inside another div
    The third p inside another div is more like a grandchild not a child...

    Both p1 and p2 are general siblings of container div as .... div(container) and p1,p2 are both children of body
    p1 is the adjacent sibling of container.. p2 is not -->



    <div id = "container">
        <p>This is p1</p>
        <p>This is p2</p>
        <div>
            <p>This is p3</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is p4</p>
    <p>This is p5</p>
